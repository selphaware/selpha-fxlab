# HANDOFF2.md — Phase 2 research loop, unattended run

Written 2026-08-23 for a ~1 week unattended stretch. If you are reading this
because the session died, this file plus the checkpoints on disk are enough to
restart without losing work.

## What is running

`python -m research.bulk_ingest --config experiments/T2a-ingestion/config.toml`
under the pinned interpreter, in the background, working task card **T2a**
(bulk ingestion, 2015-01-01 → 2025-02-28, twelve pairs, newest month first).

Everything it does is checkpointed. Nothing is held only in memory:

| file | what it is | write discipline |
|---|---|---|
| `experiments/T2a-ingestion/chunks.jsonl` | one record per completed pair-month | appended and flushed per record |
| `experiments/T2a-ingestion/sessions.jsonl` | one record per **finished** session | appended at session end |
| `experiments/ledger.jsonl` | start/end per run, append-only | start written *before* the run |
| `data/research/manifests/pair=<P>/<YYYY-MM>/manifest.json` | per pair-month hour records | rewritten atomically every 50 hours |
| `data/research/ticks/…`, `data/research/bars/…` | the store | every file written via tmp + `os.replace` |

## How to restart it

Just run it again. It reads `chunks.jsonl` to skip completed pair-months and
each manifest shard to skip settled hours, and `resume_calibration` recovers the
concurrency level and its baselines from `sessions.jsonl`.

```
E:\CODE\selpha-fxlab\env_fxlab\Scripts\python.exe -E -s -m research.bulk_ingest \
    --config experiments\T2a-ingestion\config.toml
```

**After an unclean stop, verify before resuming.** A crash can leave tick files
written after a manifest's last checkpoint. They are unsettled but present, and
the tick reader globs a day directory rather than consulting the manifest, so
they would read as settled data. Delete any `*.parquet` under the in-flight
pair-month that no manifest entry references, then resume; the run re-asks for
those hours. This happened once already — see commit `9406719`, which also
records the checks worth repeating (no leftover `*.tmp`, every manifest shard
parses, settled hours re-read with matching row counts and timestamps).

## The standing plan

1. **T2a** to completion, milestone commit + push at each completed calendar
   year.
2. **T2a closing sequence**, per `taskcards/T2a.md`: `--retry-gaps` sweep to
   re-ask every recorded gap, regenerate `experiments/T2a-ingestion/result.json`
   via `python -m research.run`, write `reports/T2a_ingestion.md`, research gate
   exit 0 on `experiments/T2a-ingestion`, commit and push.
3. **T2b** — and only if `taskcards/T2b.md`'s hard start condition is satisfied:
   T2a's closing sequence fully complete, and nothing parked or blocked. If T2a
   ends in any other state, T2b does not start.
4. Stop. Do not begin T3.

## Park conditions

Stop cleanly, commit, push, and wait for the user rather than improvising:

* `FEED_UNREACHABLE` — the driver raises it after 3 hours of the feed answering
  nothing. An unreachable external dependency is a stop-and-report.
* Research gate exit **2** (harness) or **3** (environment). Do not touch
  `research/` or `fxlab/` for either.
* The same gate failure surviving three genuine fix attempts.
* Anything the task card does not cover.

To stop the driver cleanly, create the file named by its `--stop-file` argument;
it finishes the hour in flight and writes its session record.

## Feed behaviour measured on this run

Worth knowing before diagnosing a slow run as broken:

* The feed refuses service in phases, answering HTTP 503 to valid requests from
  every address DNS offers. Five such outages so far, all self-clearing:
  24, 3, 5, 8 and 16 minutes, none near the 3-hour budget.
* The concurrency ceiling of 4 is a ceiling, not a target. Level 4 has twice run
  ~10% throttled and been backed off; on one occasion level 3 ran 20% throttled
  and dropping to level 2 produced *ten times* the completed work. Let the
  calibrator find the level — it is a measured quantity, not a configured one.
* ~131 hours have warned that p99.9 spread exceeds the 40-pip sanity ceiling.
  81% sit on 21:00Z — 17:00 America/New_York, the daily rollover. Warnings, not
  rejections; the hours store normally.

## Rules that are not mine to bend

`verify/` and `verify2/` are the judges and are deny-edited. The seal is
2025-03-01 onward. The ledger is append-only — corrections are appended, never
edited in place. A task card is executed, not reinterpreted; if it does not
cover the situation, that is a park condition.
